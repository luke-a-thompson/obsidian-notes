## Countable Sets $\aleph_{0}$
*Countable sets* are finite or can be put in a bijection with $\mathbb{N}$.

A set $A$ is *finite of cardinality* if there is a bijective mapping from a finite series:
$$
f: \{1,2,\dots,n\} \to A
$$

A set $A$ is *countably* *infinite* if there is a bijective mapping from $\mathbb{N}$ such that:
$$
\mathbb{N}: \{1,2,3,\dots\} \to A
$$

The [[Cartesian Product]] between two countably infinite sets $A,B$ is also countably infinite due to [[Cantor's Pairing Function]].

**Example:**
The set of even natural numbers $2\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite as $\mathbb{N} \to 2\mathbb{N}$:
$$
\begin{align}
1 &\to 2 \\
2 &\to 4 \\
3 &\to 6 \\
\vdots &\to \vdots \\
\mathbb{N} &\to 2\mathbb{N}
\end{align}
$$
## Uncountable Sets $\aleph_{1}$
The reals $\mathbb{R}$ are uncountable due to [[Cantor's Diagonalisation Argument]] which states there cannot be a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$.
