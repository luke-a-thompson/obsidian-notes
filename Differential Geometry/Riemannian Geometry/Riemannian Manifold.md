A *Riemannian manifold* ($M,g$) is a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a [[Riemannian Metric]] which varies smoothly across the manifold.

## Riemannian Gradient
For a smooth function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ on a Riemannian manifold $M,g$, the *Riemannian gradient* $\text{grad} f(p)$ at point $p \in M$ is the unique **tangent vector** such that:
$$
g_{p}(\text{grad}f(p),v) = df_{p}(v)
$$for all tangent vector $v \in T_{p}M$.

The gradient then represents the direction to move on the manifold to increase $f$ most rapidly.
