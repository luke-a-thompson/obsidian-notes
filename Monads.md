Functor
* Object with a mechanism to do something with that value

Endofunctor
* Same as a normal functor, but returns something with the same shape as the original functor (value can be different)

Monoid
* Set of elements with a binary operations
* E.g. combine 2 elements to produce a 3rd

**Monad - A monoid in the domain of endofunctors**
* Must be associative - Different sequence of functions should produce same value as *
