A matrix $A$ is *singular* or *degenerate* if it does not have a [[Matrix Inverse]]. **It indicates that the system of linear equations the matrix represents does not have a solution or has infinitely many.**

### Properties
1. $0$ determinant
2. No [[Matrix Inverse]]
3. Linearly dependent rows or columns
4. [[Rank#Exact Rank Deficiency]]
5. At least one $0$ eigenvalue
6. Non-unique (infinite or none) solutions to the linear equations it describes
