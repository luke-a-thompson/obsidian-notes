## Hermitian / Conjugate Transpose
For real matrices and vectors, the Hermitian transpose $x^{*}$ reduces to the usual transpose $x^{T}$.

## Hermitian Matrices
For real matrices and vectors, the condition of being Hermitian reduces to that of being symmetric.

### Qualities (also true of [[Symmetric Matrices]])
1. Diagonalisable with only real [[eigenvalues]]
