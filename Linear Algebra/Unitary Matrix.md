A matrix $U$ is unitary if its inverse $U^{-1}$ equals it's Hermitian or normal transpose:
$$U^{*}U=UU^{*}=I$$
### Properties
1. All unitary matrices are [[Normal Matrices]] because if $U$ is unitary, $U^{*}U=I \text{and }UU^{*}=I \implies U^{*}U=UU^{*}$. This is the definition of [[Normal Matrices|normality]].
	* The converse is **not** true, not all [[Normal Matrices]] are unitary.
