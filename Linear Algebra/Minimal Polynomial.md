The minimal polynomial is the smallest polynomial which annihilates a matrix $A$.

### Calculation
1. Find the [[Characteristic Polynomial]] of $A$: $p_{A}(\lambda)=\text{det}(\lambda I - A)$.
2. Use [[Cayley-Hamilton theorem]]: $A$ must satisfy its own characteristic polynomial $P_{A}(A) = 0$
3. Starting with $P_A$, test lower-degree polynomials to find the one that satisfies $m(A)=0$, where $m$ are the polynomials
