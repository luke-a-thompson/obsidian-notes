Schur's theorem: Every square matrix $A$ is [[Similar Matrices|similar]] to one in the upper Hessenberg form. Hence, the Hessenberg form of $A$ has the same eigenvalues as $A$.
### Upper Hessenberg Matrix
Zero entries below the first subdiagonal.

### Lower Hessenberg Matrix
Zero entries above the first superdiagonal

## Hessenberg Decomposition
A decomposition of a matrix $A$ into a [[Unitary Matrix]] $P$ and Hessenberg matrix $H$ such that:
$$PHP^{*}=A$$This is possible for every square matrix.
