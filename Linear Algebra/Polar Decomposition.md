## Intuition
* P stretches a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ in the direction of the eigenvectors of $P$ by amounts determined by the eigenvalues of $P$. It is [[Positive Definite Matrices|positive semi-definite]]
* U is an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal matrix]] so preserves angles and [[Vector Norms]]. **It only rotates the vector $v$.**
