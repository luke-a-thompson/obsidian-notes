[[Normal Matrices|Normal]]: A matrix $U$ that [[commutes]] with it's own [[Hermitian Matrices & Tranpose]]:
$$U^{*}U=UU^{*}$$

### Qualities
1. $U$ is diagonalisable by a [[Unitary Matrix]]
2. The [[Matrix Norms#Frobenius Norm|Frobenius norm]] of $U$ can be computed by the eigenvalues of $U$: $tr(A^{*}A) = \sum_{j}\limits|\lambda_{j}|^{2}$.
