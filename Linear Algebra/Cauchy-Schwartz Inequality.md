The absolute value of the [[Inner Product]] of two [[Unit Vector|unit vectors]] is always $\leq 1$. This is because, if two unit vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ are at an angle $\theta$ to each other, their [[Inner Product]] is given by $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{U} = \cos \theta$. Since the cosine of any angle $\theta$ ranges between -1 and 1, it follows that $|\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{U}| = |\cos \theta| \leq 1$.
$$u \cdot v \le \|u\|\times\|v\|$$
