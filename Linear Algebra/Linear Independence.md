A matrix $A$ is linearly independent if no columns can be written as linear combinations of the others. Therefore, the only solution to $A\vec{x}=0$ would be when $x$ is the zero vector.

If a matrix has $\geq1$ linearly dependent columns it is [[Rank|rank deficient]].

### Qualities:
* $Det(A) \neq 0$ - Also a quality of [[Matrix Inverse]]
