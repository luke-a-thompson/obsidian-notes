The triangle inequality states:
$$\|v+w\| \leq \|v\|+\|w\|$$
and can be reformulated as:
$$\|v-w\| \geq \|v\|-\|w\|$$

The right sign can also be flipped because:
1. The difference between $v$ and $w$ is $v-w=v+(-w)$
2. Applying the triangle inequality on $v$ and $-w$: $\|v+(-w\|) \leq \|v|\ + \|-w\|$
3. Because the norm of a vector is the absolute value: $\|-w\| = \|w\|$
4. Therefore:
	* The right remains unchanged
	* The $+(-w)$ on the right becomes $+(+w)$ as $\|w\| = |w| = +w$
	* So the inequality becomes: $\|v-w\| \leq \|v\|+\|w\|$
