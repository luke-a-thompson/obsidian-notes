Equations with more equations than unknowns. Typically unsolvable.

### Example
Consider the following system of linear equations:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\3&4\\5&6\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}
$$
Which corresponds to the equations:
$$
\begin{align}
1x_1+2x_{2}&= 0\\
3x_1+4x_{2}&= 1\\
5x_1+6x_{2}&= 1\\
\end{align}
$$
This system is unlikely to have an exact solution, but may be approximated by [[least-squares]].
