The *Wishart distribution* is a probability distribution over [[Positive Definite Matrices|symmetric positive definite]] (SPD) matrices. It is a multivariate case of the [[Chi-Squared Distribution]]. A Wishart-distributed random variable is denoted:
$$
X \sim \text{Wishart}(V,n)
$$Where:
* $V$ is a scale matrix
* $n$ is the derees of freedom
* $X$ is SPD with probability $1$
