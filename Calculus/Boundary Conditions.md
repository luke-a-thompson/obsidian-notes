## Types of Boundary Conditions
Consider the heat equation
### Neumann
Imposes the constraint where the spatial derivative is $0$ at both endpoints. For the heat equation, given $x$ is the length of a rod, the derivative would be $0$ at $x=0$ and $x=L$
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(0,t) = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(L, t) \text{ for all } T>0
$$
