**Intuition - Discretises (meshes) a function (with infinitely many points) into a finite object**
* *Nodes* - Points at which the function is assumed unknown
* *Elements* - Parts of the function between the nodes
	* There is a finite number of elements with finite size, as there are finite number of nodes
	* N elements is inversely proportional to discretisation error - Convergence
* *Shape functions* - The approximate functions between the nodes
	* E.g., Linear, polynomials
