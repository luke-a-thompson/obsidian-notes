A partial sum $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms of a series:
$$
S_{n}=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}a_k
$$This is necessary as the base series is **infinite** and we can therefore only examine how it behaves on a finite number of terms. We cannot evaluate infinite sums.
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &= \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\
S_2 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 0.75 \\
S_3 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = 0.875 \\
S_4 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = 0.9375 \end{align*}
$$These partial sums [[Convergence & Divergence|converge]] to $1$.
