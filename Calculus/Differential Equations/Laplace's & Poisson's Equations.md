The Laplace operator $\nabla^{2}$ in 3D is:
$$
\nabla^{2} = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z^2}
$$
The Laplace equation describes a system in steady state:
$$
\nabla^{2}f=0
$$

When the right hand side is specified as a function $h(x,y,z)$, we have Poisson's equation: ^a601c7
$$
\nabla f=h
$$
This is a simple [[Elliptic PDE]]
