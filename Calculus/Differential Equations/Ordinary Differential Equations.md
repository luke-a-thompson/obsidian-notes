The *order* of a differential equation is the highest order derivative in the equation.
* An $n$-th order ODE requires $n$ initial conditions 
## Population Growth Example
Consider an ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing population growth:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=kx
$$Where:
* $x$ is the population
* $t$ is the time
* $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the instantaneous rate of change in population
* $k$ is a constant growth rate
Hence, as $x$ increases, the instantaneous rate of change in population $\frac{dx}{dt}$ increases (the rate of growth increases).
