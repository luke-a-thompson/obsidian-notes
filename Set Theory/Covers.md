A *cover* $C$ of a set $X$ is a collection of subsets $\{U_{a}\}_{a\in a}$ of X whose union in the whole space of $X$. 

Formally if $C$ is an indexed family of subsets $U_{a}\subset X$:
$$
C = \{U_{a}:a \in A\}
$$It is said that $C$ *covers* A if:
$$
\bigcup_{a \in A}U_{a}\supseteq X
$$As each element of $X$ belongs to $\geq 1$ of the subsets in the family $U_{a}$.
