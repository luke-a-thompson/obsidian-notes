*Minimax optimality* refers to achieving the best possible performance in the worst-case scenario:
$$
R*(A) = \inf_{A}\sup_{p\in P}R(A,p)
$$Where:
* $R(A,p)$ is the risk (error) of algorithm $A$ on problem $p$.
* $\sup_{p\in P}$ is the worst possible problem $p$ in the problem set $P$.
* $\inf_{a}$ is the best possible algorithm at minimising the error $R(A,p)$.
