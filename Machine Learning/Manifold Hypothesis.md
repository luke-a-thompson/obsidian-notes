## Manifold Hypothesis

The manifold hypothesis is a fundamental assumption in machine learning stating that natural high-dimensional data (like images, text, audio) tends to lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space.
### Key Ideas
- High-dimensional data isn't uniformly distributed across all dimensions
- Data concentrates around a lower-dimensional structure (manifold)
- Local neighborhoods on manifold preserve semantic meaning
- Dimension of manifold (d) << Dimension of ambient space (D)

### Examples
- Images: 1000x1000 pixel image lives in $\mathbb{R}^{1000000}$ but natural images occupy tiny subset
- Audio: Speech signals have many possible parameters but human speech occupies small manifold
- Text: Word embeddings cluster meaningful relationships in lower dimensions
