A walk is a sequence $v_{0}, e_{1}, v_{2}\dots e_{n-1}, v_{n}$ such that $\forall_{i}: e_{i} = \{v_{i-1}, v_{i}\}$
* A closed walk starts and ends at the same vertices

A graph $G$ is connected if $\forall\ u,v \in G(V)\ u\text{-}v\text{ walk}$ 

An Euler tour is a walk in which every edge is visited exactly once. It can repeat multiple vertices.

## Euler's Theorem
A connected graph has an Euler tour iff every $v$ has even degree.
